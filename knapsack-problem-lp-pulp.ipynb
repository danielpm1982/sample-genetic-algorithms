    "#### This script exemplifies a problem of filling up a knapsack with travel items - each with an importance value number and mass, by modeling an objective function (maximum importance value items packed), based on decision variables (binary format: 1 - included or 0 - excluded) and some restrictions regarding the total mass of the final knapsack. The objective is to find the most important items that should be included (and the least important ones that should not), so that the maximum importance value sum is reached, for the final set of packaged items. Part of restrictions concerns to the \"weight\" (mass in grams) of the total set of items included. It should be included the most important items but limited to the maximum total weight. After modeling, the solver is used to solve the problem and the results are returned with the final sum of importance values of the items included (objective function's value), as well as the binary flag of inclusion (or not) of each individual item - 0 or 1 (decision variables' values). Here, no evolutionary computation is done (including genetic algorithms), only traditional deterministic linear programming, returning always the same optimal result. For a bigger number of variables, this problem would turn difficult to be computed, if not impossible. Here, only nine decision variables are used."

    "#### As a conclusion, and considering the maximization of value of items included at the knapsack, we could include all except the water bottle, and the restriction <=5000g would have been obeyed. The maximum value for the whole knapsack would be 41. If you change the coefficients at the restriction (mass) or at the objective function (importance value), for one or more of the items, the result will change as well, and the included items set will differ. We have another solution, which would be to include all but the tennis and the camera items. The objective function would also be 41 in value, and the <=5000g restriction would still be obeyed. The only prioritization here is regarding the objective function total value, there's no prioritization regarding the mass (e.g. the lowest possible total mass), as long as the total mass keeps <= 5000g."
