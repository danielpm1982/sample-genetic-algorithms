    "#### This script exemplifies a problem of formulating animal feed rations, by modeling an objective function (minimum price), based on decision variables (ingredients' percentage) and some restrictions regarding the ingredients. The objective is to find the percentage or mass of each ingredient (totalling 1=100% or 1kg), so that the minimum price (cost) is reached for the final ration mixture. Part of restrictions concerns to the minimum protein and calcium at the final mixture (in percentage), considering protein and calcium content by each individual ingredient (per kg). After modeling, the solver is solved, and results are returned, with the final minimum price of the ration (per kg) (objective function's value), as well as the percentage of each ingredient at that final feed product (decision variables' values). Here, no evolutionary computation is done (including genetic algorithms), only traditional deterministic linear programming, returning always the same optimal result. For a bigger number of variables, this problem would turn difficult to be computed, if not impossible. Here, only three decision variables are used."
